Machine learing using random forest model in R

/EDA was created in collaboration with classmates.  
I did all of the code and modeling for the rf model as well as the data cleaning  

I only wrote the part about our rf model in the report.

See randomForest.R for modeling  
See clean_autos_dataset.R for data cleaning
